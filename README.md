This is a project I worked on in my third semester, implementing a set of numerical methods taught in the course without the usage of any libraries other than simple functions. This definitely isn't my best work, but it was nice and maybe I'll come back to this in the future :)

Each assignment out of the five contains an implementation of a different numerical task,
use the following key to navigate:

- assignment 1 - interoplation of a given function
- assignment 2 - finding the intersection points for two functions
- assignment 3 - finding the area enclosed between two given functions
- assignment 4 - fitting a model function of my choice to data that I sampled from a given function
- assignment 5 - the same as assignment 4, only this time we were allowed to use any numeric optimization libraries and tools

Each assignmet includes a set of unittests so feel free to use these or learn from them to run the code,
Enjoy ðŸ¥³
