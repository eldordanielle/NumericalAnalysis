# Numerical Analysis Project

This project was developed during my third semester, focusing on implementing a set of numerical methods taught in the course. The implementations were done without the use of any external libraries, relying solely on basic functions. While it may not represent my best work, it was a valuable learning experience, and I might revisit and improve it in the future.

## Project Overview

Each of the five assignments covers a distinct numerical task, as detailed below:

### Assignment 1: Function Interpolation ðŸ“ˆ
Interpolation involves estimating values between two known values. In this assignment, I implemented interpolation for a given function.

### Assignment 2: Intersection Points of Two Functions ðŸ“Š
This assignment focused on finding the points where two functions intersect.

### Assignment 3: Area Enclosed Between Two Functions ðŸ§®
The task was to calculate the area enclosed between two given functions, providing insight into integration and area calculations.

### Assignment 4: Model Fitting Without Libraries ðŸ”§
Here, I fitted a model function of my choice to data sampled from a given function. This involved creating the fitting algorithm from scratch.

### Assignment 5: Model Fitting With Libraries ðŸ“š
Similar to Assignment 4, but this time, the use of numeric optimization libraries and tools was allowed to enhance the fitting process.

## Running the Code

Each assignment includes a set of unit tests to facilitate code execution and validation. You are welcome to use these tests or adapt them as needed.

## Conclusion

This project was a step in my journey to understand and implement numerical methods. Although it may not be perfect, it represents a significant learning milestone. I hope you find it informative and useful.
